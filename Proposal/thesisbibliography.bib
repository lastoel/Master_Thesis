	abstract = {Purpose Since the publication of its first results in 2000, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) implemented by the OECD has repeatedly been the subject of heated debate. In late 2014 controversy flared up anew, with the most severe critics going so far as to call for a halt to the programme. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the methodological design of PISA and the ideological basis of scientific and policy arguments invoked for and against it. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the soundness of the survey methodology and identify the conflicting interpretations and values fuelling the debate. Findings The authors find that while PISA has promoted the focus on the important subject of children's education worldwide there are legitimate concerns about what PISA measures, and how. The authors conclude that the OECD should be more transparent in the documentation of the methodological choices that underlie the creation of the data and more explicit about the impact of these choices on the results. More broadly, the authors advise caution in the attempt to derive and apply evidence-based policy in the domain of education; the authors furthermore propose an alternative model of social inquiry that is sensitive and robust to the concerns of the various actors and stakeholders that may be involved in a given policy domain. Originality/value The issues and tensions surrounding the PISA survey can be better understood in the framework of post-normal science (PNS), the application of which to the PISA controversy offers a potential solution to a stalemate.},

When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is ‘distinct’ from θ. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},

	abstract = {The identification of the causal effects of educational policies is the top priority in recent education economics literature. As a result, a shift can be observed in the strategies of empirical studies. They have moved from the use of standard multivariate statistical methods, which identify correlations or associations between variables only, to more complex econometric strategies, which can help to identify causal relationships. However, exogenous variations in databases have to be identified in order to apply causal inference techniques. This is a far from straightforward task. For this reason, this paper provides an extensive and comprehensive overview of the literature using quasi-experimental techniques applied to three well-known international large-scale comparative assessments, such as PISA, PIRLS or TIMSS, over the period 2004–2016. In particular, we review empirical studies employing instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, difference in differences and propensity score matching to the above databases. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of estimation strategies, issues treated and profitability in terms of the quality of publications to encourage further potential evaluations. The paper concludes with some operational recommendations for prospective researchers in the field.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in using machine learning (ML) methods for causal inference due to their (nearly) automatic and flexible ability to model key quantities such as the propensity score or the outcome model. Unfortunately, most ML methods for causal inference have been studied under single-level settings where all individuals are independent of each other and there is little work in using these methods with clustered or nested data, a common setting in education studies. This paper investigates using one particular ML method based on random forests known as Causal Forests to estimate treatment effects in multilevel observational data. We conduct simulation studies under different types of multilevel data, including two-level, three-level, and cross-classified data. Our simulation study shows that when the ML method is supplemented with estimated propensity scores from multilevel models that account for clustered/hierarchical structure, the modified ML method outperforms preexisting methods in a wide variety of settings. We conclude by estimating the effect of private math lessons in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data, a large-scale educational assessment where students are nested within schools.},

It remains, however, quite challenging to simulate predictive counterfactual scenarios and their outcomes, especially if the sample size is small, or if a baseline control group is unavailable. To overcome these constraints, the current paper proﬀers a Bayesian Networks approach to visualize the dynamics of the spread of “energy” within a pedagogical system, so that educational stakeholders, rather than computer scientists, can also harness entropy to work for them. The paper uses descriptive analytics to investigate “what has already happened?” in the collected data, followed by predictive analytics with controllable parameters to simulate outcomes of “what-if?” scenarios in the experimental Bayesian Network computational model to visualize how eﬀects spread when interventions are applied. The conceptual framework and analytical procedures in this paper could be implemented using Bayesian Networks software, so that educational researchers and stakeholders would be able to use their own schools’ data and produce ﬁndings to inform and advance their practice.},

I then discuss the elements of Bayesian inference arguing that methods and models of causal inference can benefit from the Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainty. Next I outline one method of causal inference that I believe is fruitful for addressing causal questions with large-scale educational assessments within the potential outcomes framework—namely, propensity score analysis. I then discuss the quantification of uncertainty in propensity score analysis through a Bayesian approach. Next, I discuss a series of necessary conditions for addressing causal questions with large-scale educational assessments.

Some countries put more emphasis on the use of performance to place students into tracks (e.g. the Netherlands), while in other countries parents have more influence on the track their child will go to (e.g. Germany). This article examines whether selection into tracks based on performance has an effect on the relation between tracking and student performance and educational opportunities. Using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment for around 185 000 students in 31 countries, different estimation models are compared. The results indicate that a highly differentiated system is best for performance when schools always consider prior performance when deciding on student acceptance. In systems with a few tracks, there is no such impact. Equality of opportunity is best provided for in a system with many tracks when schools always consider prior performance.},

Propensity score matching is used to form parallelized samples of academic and non-academic track students and to eliminate the effect of selective school intake. We applied regression models on the total scores to test for the overall track effect. Furthermore, we analyze scores and gains on the subscores and check for differential item functioning in Grade 6 and in change to Grade 9. While after 3 years, no significant difference between the two tracks was apparent in the total learning competence score, we did, however, find significant differences in some subscores and in the functioning of some items. We argue that item-level analysis is important for deeper understanding of the tracking implications and may provide the basis for more precise evidence-based decisions regarding the tracking policy.},

	shorttitle = {Tracking students in secondary education},
	abstract = {This dissertation examined whether the classification of secondary school pupils into different academic levels (e.g. VMBO (preparatory secondary vocational education), HAVO (senior general secondary education), VWO (pre-university education)) improves academic performance and whether it influences the academic opportunities. For instance, we found that pupils who are about to transition to HAVO or VWO perform better at VWO level and that pupils with highly educated parents receive better academic advice from their teacher in group 8 than their academic performance warrants. We also found that early learners are often categorised at a lower academic level than late learners, and even more so in countries with early selection criteria. This additional misallocation in countries with early selection has little impact on the long-term outcomes like final academic level or salary scale.},
