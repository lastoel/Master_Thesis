	abstract = {This paper reviews recent research on causal inference with large-scale assessments in education from a Bayesian perspective. I begin by adopting the potential outcomes model of Rubin (J Educ Psychol 66:688-701, 1974) as a framework for causal inference that I argue is appropriate with large-scale educational assessments. I then discuss the elements of Bayesian inference arguing that methods and models of causal inference can benefit from the Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainty. Next I outline one method of causal inference that I believe is fruitful for addressing causal questions with large-scale educational assessments within the potential outcomes framework—namely, propensity score analysis. I then discuss the quantification of uncertainty in propensity score analysis through a Bayesian approach. Next, I discuss a series of necessary conditions for addressing causal questions with large-scale educational assessments. The paper closes with a discussion of the implications for the design of large-scale educational assessments when the goal is in asking causal questions and warranting causal claims.},

	abstract = {The identification of the causal effects of educational policies is the top priority in recent education economics literature. As a result, a shift can be observed in the strategies of empirical studies. They have moved from the use of standard multivariate statistical methods, which identify correlations or associations between variables only, to more complex econometric strategies, which can help to identify causal relationships. However, exogenous variations in databases have to be identified in order to apply causal inference techniques. This is a far from straightforward task. For this reason, this paper provides an extensive and comprehensive overview of the literature using quasi-experimental techniques applied to three well-known international large-scale comparative assessments, such as PISA, PIRLS or TIMSS, over the period 2004–2016. In particular, we review empirical studies employing instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, difference in differences and propensity score matching to the above databases. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of estimation strategies, issues treated and profitability in terms of the quality of publications to encourage further potential evaluations. The paper concludes with some operational recommendations for prospective researchers in the field.},

	abstract = {In this book, J. L. Mackie makes a careful study of several philosophical issues involved in his account of causation. Mackie follows Hume's distinction between causation as a concept and causation as it is ‘in the objects’ and attempts to provide an account of both aspects. Mackie examines the treatment of causation by philosophers such as Hume, Kant, Mill, Russell, Ducasse, Kneale, Hart and Honore, and von Wright. Mackie's own account involves an analysis of causal statements in terms of counterfactual conditionals though these are judged to be incapable of giving a complete account of causation. Mackie argues that regularity theory too can only offer an incomplete picture of the nature of causation. In the course of his analysis, Mackie critically examines the account of causation offered by Kant, as well as the contemporary Kantian approaches offered by philosophers such as Bennett and Strawson. Also addressed are issues such as the direction of causation, the relation of statistical laws and functional laws, the role of causal statements in legal contexts, and the understanding of causes both as ‘facts’ and ‘events’. Throughout the discussion of these topics, Mackie develops his own complex account of the nature of causation, finally bringing his analysis to bear in regard to the topic of teleology and the question of whether final causes can be justifiably reduced to efficient causes.},
